            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>The data charts provided has revealed a compelling correlation between the
                amount of time teenagers dedicated to the internet. Students who invest
                more hours on the internet tend to yield to have low or high GWA depends on
                how they use it. Girls spent so much time on the internet, yet they still get good
                grades. On the other hand, men spend more time on the internet but don't
                really get good grades. In our observation, this is because men use the
                internet to play online games or do unnecessary things. The digital age has
                provided an unprecedented platform for learning, socializing, and selfexpression. On one hand, the internet opens doors to a wealth of information,
                educational resources allowing the grade 9 students to broaden their horizons
                and connect with the world in ways that were unimaginable in previous
                generations.
                The value of internet, where it helps the students with the learning process as it
                helps to simplify the knowledge. In conclusion, the time Grade 9 students
                spend online is a double-edged sword, offering both opportunities and
                challenges. A concerted effort from educators and parents is necessary to
                strike a balance that combines the benefits of online resources while
                protecting student well-being. This approach aims to empower Grade 9
                students to become responsible digital citizens, who can use the Internet for
                learning and personal growth while minimizing the potential risks associated
                with excessive online use.</p>
